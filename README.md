Part 1: Density estimation and classification
In this part, you need to first perform parameter estimation for a given dataset (which is a subset from the MNIST dataset). The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. You will submit the code and a report explaining your approach and the math you used.

Part 2: Unsupervised Learning (K-means)
In this part, you are required to implement the k-means algorithm and apply your implementation on the given dataset, which contains a set of 2-D points. You are required to implement two different strategies for choosing the initial cluster centers. You will submit the code and a report explaining your approach and the math you used.

Part 3: Classification Using Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In this part, we will revisit the Handwritten Digits Recognition task in Part 1, using a convolutional neural network. The basic dataset is the same MNIST dataset from Part I, but you may choose to use only a subset for training and testing, if speed performance with the entire dataset becomes a bottleneck. For example, you may use only 6000 samples for training (each digit with 600 samples) and 1000 samples for testing (each digit with 100 samples). You will submit the code and a report explaining your approach and the math you used.
